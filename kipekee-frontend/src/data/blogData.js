      <p>Nairobi's real estate landscape is shifting rapidly. While Kilimani and Westlands remain the heavyweights, savvy investors are looking towards the periphery for the next big ROI. Here are the top 5 neighborhoods we are watching closely in 2026.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Ruaka: The Northern Frontier</h3>
      <p>Once a sleepy town, Ruaka has transformed into a major satellite hub due to the Northern Bypass. With land prices still relatively affordable compared to neighboring Runda, it offers a perfect entry point for middle-income housing developments.</p>

      <h3>2. South C: The New Commercial Hub?</h3>
      <p>With the expansion of Mombasa Road and new zoning regulations, South C is seeing a surge in mixed-use developments. It is becoming increasingly popular for young professionals who want proximity to the CBD without the CBD price tag.</p>

      <h3>3. Kangemi / Mountain View</h3>
      <p>Often overlooked, the areas bordering Westlands are experiencing a spillover effect. As Westlands becomes saturated, developers are moving slightly west to find larger parcels of land for high-density residential projects.</p>
      
      <blockquote>"The best time to buy real estate was 20 years ago. The second best time is now, provided you know where to look."</blockquote>

      <p>Investing in these emerging markets requires patience, but the long-term capital appreciation potential is significantly higher than in established suburbs.</p>

      "First impressions matter. Learn how professional staging can add up to 15% to your final sale price.",
    content: `
      <p>When selling a luxury home, you aren't just selling four walls and a roof; you are selling a lifestyle. Staging is the art of painting that picture for the buyer.</p>
      
      <h3>De-personalize, Don't De-humanize</h3>
      <p>Buyers need to envision themselves in the space. This means removing family photos and personal artifacts, but keeping enough warmth (throws, fresh flowers, art) so the home doesn't feel clinical.</p>

      <h3>The Power of Lighting</h3>
      <p>Never show a dark house. Ensure all curtains are drawn open, and if a room lacks natural light, use strategically placed floor lamps to brighten corners. In luxury real estate, light equals space.</p>

      <p>In Karen, we are seeing a massive shift towards 'Eco-Villas'—homes that generate their own power, harvest their own water, and use materials that breathe.</p>
